    "This is a no-nonsense local donut shop that's been here for longer than anyone can remember. 
    The prices can't be beat; between evening hours and early morning donuts are half price. 
    The service isn't sugary sweet but they get you out the door fast with delicious donut treats, so no complaints can be had. 
    Note: don't approach the counter with earbuds in or talking on your phone because the staff won't be impressed. 
    Their products can't be beat by any donut store in the area. I'll never go anywhere else.""
